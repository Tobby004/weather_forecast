# Weather Forecast App

The Weather Forecast App is a basic web application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to search for a city and retrieve the current weather information for that location. The app features an autocomplete city search, where users receive suggestions as they type. Upon selecting a city, the app displays the current temperature, weather description, and relevant weather data. The app has a responsive design, ensuring optimal user experience across different devices and screen sizes. The Weather Forecast App utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API for weather data. To use the app, clone the repository, obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap, and replace the placeholder with the actual key in the `app.js` file. The app is authored by Taiwo Tobiloba and can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/Tobby004/weather_forecast.git.
